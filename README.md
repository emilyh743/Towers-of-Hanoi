# Towers-of-Hanoi
Computer Organization course assignment. Program to recursively implement Towers of Hanoi game.

Computer Organization course assignment in C and MIPS.

ex1.c

Write a recursive implementation of the Towers of Hanoi game. The input will be a small number, N, which represents the number of disks, numbered 1 to N. All the disks are initially on Peg 1 (source peg), and the goal is to have them on Peg 3 (target peg) at the end. Peg 2 is available for use (spare peg). The output will be a series of moves, one per line, which look like, "Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2".
